    "text": "The past week or so has been full of troubleshooting wifi speed problems. Various changes suggested by the Hyperoptic team has not succeeded in bringing my internet speed close to the speed of 1 Gbps promised in the package I chose.\nMost recent suggestion was that I try doing the speedtest on different devices. Perhaps the experts at hyperoptic are baffled their suggestions of trying a different cable or resetting the router are not working. The trouble must be with my device! So this is what I did.\nHowever, I wondered, how will they know if the difference in speed between different devices is significant? Worry not, Hyperoptic, I was trained in statistics, and my passion for R can help us both.\nYou are welcome."

I have not tested the speed on the 2.4 Ghz band.\nThe variable device in the dataset refers to one of three devices available to me at the time of testing: personal laptop, phone, and work laptop. I was not able to conduct the speedtest on my TV because despite being connected to wifi it shows the ‘no internet’ error message."
